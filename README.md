URL Popper lets you copy link text, URLs, or both with a single click.

# Overview

When you hover over a link, its text and URL are displayed in a popup. For images or headings that have id, the popup shows the src/alt attributes or id/text content respectively.
Moving your cursor to the top of the page displays the page title and URL.
The popup offers several copying options:

- Click the top section to copy the link text or page title
- Click the bottom section to copy the destination URL or page URL
- Click the lock icon on the right to copy both text and URL
- With the lock icon active, holding Shift while clicking copies the text in Markdown format

That's all! Feel free to use it :)
